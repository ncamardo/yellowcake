Fine art landscape photography. All images on this site were originally created on film.


# Statement

There exists in nature a great deal of beauty. It is the duty of the photographer to capture that beauty with the highest attainable degree of verisimilitude. In his pursuit of truth, the photographer must exercise a great deal of responsbility – so as not to employ trickery or deceit in an attempt to appeal to the sumptuous palate. The delicate balance of light and shadow; the subtleties of nature's palette; and the grandeur of the world must at all times be respected by the landscape photographer. Admittedly, I do not always adhere to this code of conduct, but let this gallery be my humble attempt to show you the world as I see it – in all its colors and contradictions.
